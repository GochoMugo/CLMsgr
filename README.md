# CLMsgr #

> A Python Core for Command Line Messaging, with extensibility and modularity.

> **Note:** This is a young project under active development. Some nasty bugs and drastic changes should be anticipated at this stage.

**CLMsgr** tries to offload the work a everyday programmer has to do to message through a channel such as Twitter, IRC or simply send message commands to a server.

A programmer may just download and tweak a channel script, install it to the core and be ready to start connections. For die hards, coding the scripts may seem daring.

The core is aimed mainly on sending and receiving messages. Adding more functionality such as elaborate account management seems as an overkill for the project.

Currently, channel scripts have to be written in **Python**. In Future, if all goes well, **Javascript** should be supported. See [channel API][API] on how to write your own channel script.
